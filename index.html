    Albania bordering Montenegro to the northwest and Kosovo[b] to the northeast and east. 
    Valbonë Valley National Park sprawls in the northwest of Tropojë and protects the
     Valbonë Valley and the Gashi River, which has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage 
     list as portion of the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the
     Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe.[8] The area of the municipality is 1,057.3 km2 (408.2 sq mi)</p>
 <p class="lura">In behalf to a great variability in elevation, Lurë-Dejës Mt National Park is densely populated in vegetation. 
    Higher plant life consists mainly of both coniferous and deciduous trees, 
    particularly around the shores of the lakes. The most common tree native to
     Lurë is the european beech along with silver fir, black pine, red pine and bosnian pine. 
     Especially protected is the balkan pine, which is threatened with extinction and only 
     common in the west of the Balkan Peninsula. The southern section of the park has a meadow of
      multicolour flowers and several coniferous trees, which is called the Field of Mares,
       offering pristine views over the landscape. In terms of phytogeography, the park falls 
       within the Pindus Mountains mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, 
       woodlands, and scrub biome.</p>
 <p class="tepelena">Tepelenë is located on the left shore of the Vjosa River on a plateau above the river. 
    The river applies here, after the river has broken through a few kilometres in the 
    Këlcyrë Gorge a mountain chain, to the North. In addition the Drino flows at this point. North of Tepelenë, 
    the Bënça river coming from the south-west from the Kurvelesh flows into the Vjosa.
    Tepelenë was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities Kurvelesh, 
    Lopës, Qendër Tepelenë and Tepelenë, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the town 
    Tepelenë.[8]</p>
 <p class="dhermi">Dhërmi (definite Albanian form: Dhërmiu; Greek: Δρυμάδες, Drymádes) is a village in Vlorë County, Albania.
     It is part of the municipality of Himarë.[1] The village lies 42 kilometers south of the city of Vlorë and 
     about the same distance north of the southern city of Sarandë. It is built on a slope of the Ceraunian 
     Mountains at approximately 200 meters in altitude, and comprises three neighborhoods: Gjilek, Kondraq, 
     Kallami, and Dhërmi itself. The mountains descend to the southwest into the Ionian coast and Corfu in the 
     distance to the south. Nearby is the village of Palasë. The local inhabitants of Dhërmi are ethnic Greeks[2] 
     that mainly speak a variant of the Greek Himariote dialect, and partly the Tosk Albanian dialect.[3][4] 
     During the last decade, the coastal area has seen a boom in the construction of accommodation facilities, 
     such as wooden villa complexes.</p>
